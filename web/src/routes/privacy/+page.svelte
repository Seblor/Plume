    <p>
      This Privacy Policy outlines how Plume Discord Bot ("the Bot") collects,

      using the Bot, you consent to the practices described in this policy.
    </p>

    <h1 class="mt-3 mb-1 text-4xl">2. Data Collection</h1>
    <p>
      <b>2.1. Voice Chat Activity:</b> The Bot logs but does not store on its server:
      voice chat activity on Discord servers, including user joins, leaves, mutes,

      of channels.

    <p>
      <b>2.3. Configuration Data:</b> The Bot may store configuration data for each
      server to customize its behavior. This data is used exclusively for server-specific
      settings. At this time, the only stored data is the identifier ("ID") of your
      Discord server and the ID of the channel where the Bot should send the log
      messages.

      the Bot's functionality, user experience, and performance.

    <p>
      We take reasonable measures to protect the data collected by the Bot.
      However, please be aware that no data transmission over the internet is
      entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your data. By
